(** S3 functions
    All function requires a [region], [scheme] and [credentials].

    The default region is [Us_east_1].

    The default scheme is [http]. If you are connecting from outside AWS,
    it is strongly recommended that you use https.
    To use https, make sure to have the relevant opam packages installed:
    [async_ssl] for [async] and [lwt_ssl]/[tls] for [lwt].
    Please note that connections are not reused due to a limitation on the AWS endpoint.


    If no credentials is provided, the requests will not be signed,
    The bucket / objects need to be configured accordingly.

        The caller must supply a [data] sink to which retrieved data is streamed.
        The result will be determined after all data has been sent to the sink, and the data sink is closed.

        Connections to s3 is closed once the result has been determined.
        The caller should ways examine the result of the function.
        If the result is [Ok ()], then it is guaranteed that all data has been retrieved successfully and written to the data sink.
        In case of [Error _], only parts of the data may have been written to the data sink.

        The rationale for using a data sink rather than returning a pipe reader from which data
        can be consumed is that a reader does not allow simple relay of error states during the transfer.
